- [ ] ✅ Search input updates with location name
- [ ] ✅ Location can be confirmed for report

**Console Logs to Monitor**:
```
📍 Sélection du résultat de recherche: {...}
✅ Position définie depuis la recherche: {...}
```

---

### Test 4: Manual Map Selection vs Search
**Objective**: Test interaction between manual selection and search

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Search for "Yaoundé" and select result
2. ✅ Manually tap different location on map
3. ✅ Verify search results clear
4. ✅ Confirm manual selection takes precedence
5. ✅ Search again and select new result
6. ✅ Verify manual selection is replaced

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] ✅ Manual tap clears search results
- [ ] ✅ Manual selection overrides search selection
- [ ] ✅ Search selection overrides manual selection
- [ ] ✅ Only one location marker visible at a time

**Console Logs to Monitor**:
```
🧹 Résultats de recherche nettoyés (tap manuel)
✅ Location sélectionnée manuellement: {...}
```

### Test 5: Error Handling and Edge Cases
**Objective**: Test error scenarios and edge cases

**Test Cases**:
1. ✅ Search with < 3 characters: "Ya"
2. ✅ Search with invalid location: "XYZ123"
3. ✅ Search with special characters: "Yaoundé@#$"
4. ✅ Rapid typing to test debouncing
5. ✅ Network disconnection during search

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] ✅ Short queries don't trigger search
- [ ] ✅ Invalid locations show "no results" message
- [ ] ✅ Special characters handled gracefully
- [ ] ✅ Rapid typing doesn't spam API (debouncing works)
- [ ] ✅ Network errors show user-friendly message

---

### Test 6: Rate Limiting and Performance
**Objective**: Verify API rate limiting and performance

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Perform multiple rapid searches
2. ✅ Monitor console for rate limiting messages
3. ✅ Verify 1-second minimum between requests
4. ✅ Test search performance with long queries
5. ✅ Check memory usage during extended use

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] ✅ Rate limiting prevents API spam
- [ ] ✅ Console shows rate limiting messages
- [ ] ✅ Performance remains smooth
- [ ] ✅ No memory leaks during extended use

**Console Logs to Monitor**:
```
🚫 Rate limiting: attente avant prochaine recherche
```

### Test 7: Integration with Existing Navigation
**Objective**: Ensure search doesn't break existing functionality

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Fill report form with description and photo
2. ✅ Navigate to map with "🗺️ Choisir sur la carte"
3. ✅ Use search to find location
4. ✅ Confirm location selection
5. ✅ Verify return to form preserves all data
6. ✅ Test back button functionality

**Expected Results**:
- [ ] ✅ Form data preserved during map navigation
- [ ] ✅ Search functionality doesn't interfere with data preservation
- [ ] ✅ Back button works correctly
- [ ] ✅ No new navigation loops introduced
- [ ] ✅ All previous fixes remain functional
